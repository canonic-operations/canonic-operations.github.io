# CANONIC OPERATIONS — BUSINESS

inherits: canonic-operations/CANON.md

---

## Axiom

**CANONIC = Control EVOLUTION GOVERNANCE.**

**UPPER governs. lower governed.**

---

## The UNICORN

```
$1.2T   AI Market (2030)
$300B   Healthcare AI
$50B    Governance/Compliance
$10B    ML Platform Tools

CANONIC governs ALL of them.
```

### Market Position

| Market | Size | CANONIC Capture |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| AI Governance | $50B | DETROS runtime |
| Healthcare AI | $300B | MAMMOCHAT template |
| Enterprise Compliance | $150B | CANONIC COMPLIANCE |
| ML Platform | $10B | LEARNING MACHINES |

**Total Addressable: $510B. CANONIC = The Governance Layer.**

---

## FOUNDATION → DECK → DOMAINS

```
FOUNDATION
    ↓ deploys
LEARNING MACHINES
    ↓ governed by
DETROS (runtime)
    ↓ pitched via
DECK (NDA)
    ↓ sold to
DOMAINS
    ↓ markets to
UNIVERSE
```

### The Flow

| Stage | UPPER | governed | Evidence |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| BUILD | FOUNDATION | deploys LMs | DETROS.py |
| PITCH | DECK | presents NDA | GitHub auth |
| SELL | COMPLIANCE | licenses runtime | Enterprise |
| SCALE | DOMAINS | markets apps | SHOP |

---

## COMPOSE

| GOVERNOR | governed | COMPOSITION |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| CANONIC | agent | CANONIC AGENT |
| LEARNING | machine | LEARNING MACHINE |
| DETROS | language | DETROS LANGUAGE |
| NDA | talk | NDA TALK |
| WORK | talk | WORK TALK |
| SHOP | talk | SHOP TALK |
| COIN | talk | COIN TALK |

**UPPER governs. lower governed. Composition sells.**

---

## TALK

| TALK | We Govern | They Governed |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| NDA TALK | Present NDA | sign nda |
| WORK TALK | Define WORK | request work |
| SHOP TALK | Sell SHOP | browse shop |
| COIN TALK | Issue COIN | buy coin |

### TALK Flow

```
NDA TALK → WORK TALK → SHOP TALK → COIN TALK

1. NDA TALK: Ledger them (GitHub auth)
2. WORK TALK: Build on DETROS
3. SHOP TALK: Distribute via SHOP
4. COIN TALK: License COMPLIANCE
```

---

## CREDIT | RESERVES

| EXTERNAL | INTERNAL |
|----------|----------|
| CREDIT | RESERVES |
| COIN | TOKEN |
| TALK | CHAT |
| ENTERPRISE | tier 63 |
| COMPLIANCE | detros |
| DOMAINS | foundation |

**CREDIT = what they see. RESERVES = what we hold.**

---

## PATENT LAYERING

| Layer | VISIBILITY | protection |
|-------|------------|------------|
| LANGUAGE | PUBLIC | adoption |
| runtime | CLOSED | moat |
| COMPLIANCE | LICENSED | revenue |
| learning | INTERNAL | AI |

```
PUBLIC LANGUAGE → community adopts
CLOSED runtime → we control
LICENSED COMPLIANCE → they pay
INTERNAL learning → we compound
```

---

## DETROS

```
D E T R O S
1 2 4 8 16 32 = 63

+ L (64) = 127 (AGENT)
+ LANG (128) = 255 (FULL)
```

### Tightening

| Bit | Layer | OPEN | VALUE |
|-----|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | D | PUBLIC | doctrine |
| 2 | E | PUBLIC | evidence |
| 4 | T | PUBLIC | temporal |
| 8 | R | PUBLIC | relations |
| 16 | O | CLOSED | operations |
| 32 | S | CLOSED | structure |
| 64 | L | CLOSED | learning |
| 128 | LANG | PUBLIC | language |

```
PUBLIC = 143 bits (DETR + LANG)
CLOSED = 112 bits (OS + L)
TOTAL = 255 bits

143 open → adoption
112 closed → moat
255 complete → UNICORN
```

### DETROS.py

```
DETROS.py = ONE encrypted runtime

VaaS = COMPLIANCE validation
FaaS = CANON → HTML rendering
LaaS = LEARNING MACHINE AI

One file. Encrypted. Patented. $1B+ value.
```

## EXIT

| TARGET | OFFER | VALUE |
|--------|-------|-------|
| APPLE | COMPLIANCE health | $10B+ |
| MICROSOFT | DETROS azure | $5B+ |
| META | GOVERNANCE layer | $3B+ |
| OPENAI | LEARNING MACHINES | $5B+ |
| ANTHROPIC | CANONIC CONSTITUTION | $2B+ |

### EXIT Thesis

```
Each giant NEEDS governance. We OWN solution.

APPLE: 30% App Store cut needs COMPLIANCE
MICROSOFT: Azure/GitHub needs governance
META: Metaverse failed without GOVERNANCE
OPENAI: GPT needs constitutional alignment
ANTHROPIC: Claude needs CANONIC CONSTITUTION

Total EXIT opportunity: $25B+
```
