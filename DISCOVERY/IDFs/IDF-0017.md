# INVENTION DISCLOSURE FORM

**IDF-0017**

---

## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** PAPER vN

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** canonic-foundation/COMPLIANCE/PUBLICATIONS.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

---

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for patent, publication.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in canonic-foundation lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**PAPER vN**

**OPEN**

### Source Context

# TIERS — PUBLICATIONS

inherits: /CANONIC/

---

## Purpose

Maps versioned publications to governance tiers. Each paper version corresponds to a tier boundary.

---

## Publication Series

```
V0 (MACHINE)      → COMMUNITY/BUSINESS (OPEN)
V1 (FOUNDATION)   → COMMUNITY/BUSINESS (OPEN)
V2 (APPS/VaaS)    → ENTERPRISE (CLOSED)
V3 (BLOCKCHAIN)   → TRUSTLESS (distributed)
```

---

## Version-to-Tier Mapping

| Version | Era | Tier | IP Status | Patent |
|---------|-----|------|-----------|--------|...

---

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 3 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader canonic-foundation ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

---

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | canonic-foundation/COMPLIANCE/PUBLICATIONS.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | edae1ba9 |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2026-01-29 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 3 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. Patent |
|---------|-----|------|-----------|--------|
| V0 | MACHINE | COMMUNITY | OPEN | HADLEY-PROV-001/002 |
| V1 | FOUNDATION | BUSINESS | OPEN | HADLEY-PROV-003 |
| V2 | APPS | ENTERPRISE | CLOSED | HADLEY-PROV-004 |
| V3 | BLOCKCHAIN | TRUSTLESS | TRUSTLESS | HADLEY-PROV-005 |

---

## Publication Pattern

Each version follows:

```
PAPER vN → OPEN → PATENT → PUBLISH vN (advertises v(N+1)) → PAPER v(N+1)
```

- **PAPER vN**: Write the paper
- **OPEN**: Make publicly accessible (scope goes PUBLIC)
- **PATENT**: File provisional (within 1-year grace)
- **PUBLISH vN**: Formal venue (medRxiv/arXiv), teases v(N+1)

---

## Version Coverage

### V0 (MACHINE)

**Topic:** Compiler Correspondence (Governance Axioms)
**Proves:** GOVERNANCE ≅ COMPILATION
**Freezes:** Minimal kernel (3 axioms)
**Status:** FROZEN (Jan 23, 2026)

### V1 (FOUNDATION)

**Topic:** Complete Governance Paradigm (Language Spec)
**Proves:** Governance is constitutional
**Freezes:** Complete governance theory
**Status:** MANUSCRIPT READY

### V2 (APPS)

**Topic:** Distribution Theory (VaaS + Economics)
**Proves:** Validation has value
**Freezes:** VaaS implementation, certification
**Status:** SPEC ONLY

### V3 (BLOCKCHAIN)

**Topic:** Trustless Governance (Distributed CANONIC)
**Proves:** Governance can be trustless
**Freezes:** Multi-remote, OpenTimestamps, IPFS
**Status:** SPEC ONLY

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 3 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

---

## 8. INVENTOR DECLARATION

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
3. AI systems contributed analysis under governance but are not inventors
4. This disclosure is automatically generated pending human review
