# INVENTION DISCLOSURE FORM

**IDF-0199**

---

## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Dual-function token

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION/DISCLOSURE-008.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

---

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for novelty, statement, claim.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**Dual-function token**

**Mathematical closure per tier**

Novelty Statement

This disclosure extends the Constitutional Governance paradigm (DISCLOSURE-001) with a novel tier-based token economics model.

### Source Context

# DISCLOSURE-008: Tier-Based Token Economics

inherits: /PATENTS-PROTECTION/CANON.md

---

## Title

Tier-Based Token Economics for Governance Systems

---

## Filing Date

2026-01-24

---

## Priority Claim

Continuation of DISCLOSURE-001 (Constitutional Governance) and DISCLOSURE-002 (Platform Business)

---

## Claims

### Claim 1: COIN/TOKEN Duality

A method for implementing dual-function tokens in governance systems comprising:
- COIN function mapped to base tier (RESERVE)
- TOKEN function...

---

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 2 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION/DISCLOSURE-008.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | cfe8e47e |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2026-01-24 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 2 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. Novelty Statement

This disclosure extends the Constitutional Governance paradigm (DISCLOSURE-001) with a novel tier-based token economics model.
2. PATENTS-PROTECTION/CANON.
3. Claim

Continuation of DISCLOSURE-001 (Constitutional Governance) and DISCLOSURE-002 (Platform Business)

---

## Claims

### Claim 1: COIN/TOKEN Duality

A method for implementing dual-function tokens in governance systems comprising:
- COIN function mapped to base tier (RESERVE)
- TOKEN function mapped to commercial tiers (CREDIT)
- Single underlying asset with dual economic purpose

### Claim 2: Tier-Based Closure

A system for mathematical closure at each governance tier:
- COMMUNITY_CLOSURE: base governance, self-validates
- BUSINESS_CLOSURE: COMMUNITY + linter + CI/CD
- ENTERPRISE_CLOSURE: COMMUNITY + VaaS + full DETROS

### Claim 3: SCALE/SELL Strategy

A business model optimization comprising:
- SCALE strategy: maximize volume through free tier (COMMUNITY)
- SELL strategy: maximize revenue through commercial tiers (BUSINESS, ENTERPRISE)
- Conversion funnel from SCALE to SELL

### Claim 4: Financial Lens Integration

A method for mapping governance structures to financial instruments:
- COIN (RESERVE) = hold, stake, earn functions
- TOKEN (CREDIT) = spend, pay, consume functions
- Work-based value creation (not speculation)

## Evidence

### Session Evidence

- Date: 2026-01-24
- Session: Claude Opus 4.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 2 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
3. AI systems contributed analysis under governance but are not inventors
4. This disclosure is automatically generated pending human review
