## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Attorney Docket No.:

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION/applications/USPTO-PROVISIONAL-canonic-system.md

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for new, new, original episode preserved with violations documented.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

### Source Context

# UNITED STATES PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION

**Attorney Docket No.:** HADLEY-PROV-001

**Application Type:** Provisional Patent Application

---

## TITLE OF THE INVENTION

Constitutional Governance System for Human-Artificial Intelligence Collaboration with Structural Inadmissibility, Definitional Closure, Hierarchical Authority Scoping, and Self-Healing Compliance

---

## CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This provisional application establishes priority for inventive matter documen...

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 15 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION/applications/USPTO-PROVISIONAL-canonic-system.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | 89b6a463 |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2026-01-14 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 15 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. New[New Constraint]
        Q1{Universal?}
        Q2{Which Layer?}
        Place[Place Locally]
    end

    New --> Q1
    Q1 -->|yes| Root
    Q1 -->|no| Q2
    Q2 -->|execution| OS
    Q2 -->|enforcement| Machine
    Q2 -->|process| Writing
    Q2 --> Place
```

### FIG.
2. new entries referencing prior entries, preserving violation history.
3. new episodes referencing originals:
- Original episode preserved with violations documented
- New episode created with "Redo:" or "Correction:" signal
- New episode references original by number
- Both episodes remain in ledger

This preserves the learning record: violations visible, corrections traceable, evolution auditable.

## CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This provisional application establishes priority for inventive matter documented in internal disclosures IDF-001 through IDF-017, dated January 12-14, 2026, under freeze reference stack-freeze-2026-01-12 (IDF-001–016) and patents-session-2026-01-14 (IDF-017).

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 15 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
3. AI systems contributed analysis under governance but are not inventors
4. This disclosure is automatically generated pending human review
