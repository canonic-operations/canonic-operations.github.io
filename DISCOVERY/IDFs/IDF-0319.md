## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Dexter Hadley

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION/paper-draft/output/manuscript-full.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for claims without evidence references are inadmissible.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**Dexter Hadley**

**AI slop**

new commits; history rewriting is disallowed by governance.

### Source Context

# We Made an AI Write a Paper It Can't Lie About

**Dexter Hadley**

## Abstract

What if an AI could not bullshit its way through scientific prose—not because it chose not to, but because the system rendered unsupported claims inadmissible? We call this failure mode **AI slop**.

CANONIC is the governance framework we built to make AI slop structurally inadmissible. Claims must trace to a ledger; every term used in rules must be defined; the AI cannot promote its own ideas to law. Across 1...

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 2 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/canonic-hadleylab/PATENTS-PROTECTION/paper-draft/output/manuscript-full.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | 064956f4 |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2026-01-14 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 2 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. new commits; history rewriting is disallowed by governance.
2. first evidence

Claims without evidence references are inadmissible; "the system achieved compliance" means nothing unless you can point to the commit where it happened.
3. new WRITING and PAPER work against a frozen OS so the
evidence window stays stable and governance does not drift under the experiment.
4. claims inadmissible? We call this failure mode **AI slop**.
5. Claims must trace to a ledger; every term used in rules must be defined; the AI cannot promote its own ideas to law.
6. claims cite evidence references (commits, tags, episodes) so you can verify them yourself.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 2 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

## 8. INVENTOR DECLARATION

I, **Dexter Hadley**, declare that:

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
3. AI systems contributed analysis under governance but are not inventors
4. This disclosure is automatically generated pending human review
