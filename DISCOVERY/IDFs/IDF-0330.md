# INVENTION DISCLOSURE FORM

**IDF-0330**

---

## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Consumer CANON: Full Closure Evidence

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-machine/PAPER/SUPPLEMENTAL.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

---

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for validators, episode, constitutional.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-machine/PAPER lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**Consumer CANON: Full Closure Evidence**

**S1: Drift Episodes**

### Source Context

# CANONIC v0 Supplemental Material

**Consumer CANON: Full Closure Evidence**

This document indexes the supplemental material for the CANONIC paper. All supplemental material lives on GitHub (the OS). GitHub IS the supplemental archive.

---

## Supplemental Organization

| Type | Location | Content |
|------|----------|---------|
| **S1: Drift Episodes** | `paper/archive/episodes/` | 166 documented drift corrections |
| **S2: IDF Registry** | `patents/disclosures/` | 163 invention disclosures ...

---

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 3 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-machine/PAPER ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## S3: Validator Implementation (Consumer Evidence)

VaaS (Validators as a Service) - 340 lines of enforcement:

```python
# Core validators
validate_triad()        # CANON + VOCAB + README exist
validate_inheritance()  # inherits: declared, terminates at /
validate_introspection() # VOCAB defines all CANON terms
validate_case_semantics() # UPPERCASE governs, lowercase governed
validate_scope_name()   # Names are nouns or verbs
validate_identifier()   # No hyphens/underscores/spaces
```

**Validator source:** github.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 3 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified
