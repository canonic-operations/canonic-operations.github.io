# INVENTION DISCLOSURE FORM

**IDF-0335**

---

## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Novel Pattern: retired/canonic-machine/PAPER

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-machine/PAPER/CANON.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

---

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for patent, integration, claims.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-machine/PAPER lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

Pattern establishes novel governance mechanism for domain-specific operations.

### Source Context

# PAPER (/DOMAINS/paper/)

inherits: /CANONIC/language/

### 1. Publication Lifecycle

Papers MUST follow the lattice lifecycle:

```
DRAFT → DISCLOSE → PATENT → PUBLISH → ADVERTISE
D∩T     D∩T∩R      D∩E∩T∩R∩O  D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S  repeat
```

---

### 2. Version Series

```canonic
v0  CANONIC     D∩T        Draft governance axioms
v1  LANGUAGE    D∩E∩T      Add formal specification
v2  SHOP    D∩E∩T∩R    Add distribution boundary
v3  BLOCKCHAIN  D∩E∩T∩R∩O  Add enforcement layer
```

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Implementation Steps

1. Publication Lifecycle
2. Version Series

### Implementation Evidence

- 4 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-machine/PAPER ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

---

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/canonic-machine/PAPER/CANON.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | b3065c69 |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2026-01-23 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 4 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. PATENT → PUBLISH → ADVERTISE
D∩T     D∩T∩R      D∩E∩T∩R∩O  D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S  repeat
```

### 2.
2. Patent Integration

```
v0 → IDF-001, IDF-002 → PROV-001, PROV-002
v1 → IDF-003          → PROV-003
v2 → IDF-004          → PROV-004
v3 → IDF-005          → PROV-005
```

PATENT before PUBLISH.
3. Claims MUST trace to LEDGER evidence.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 4 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified
