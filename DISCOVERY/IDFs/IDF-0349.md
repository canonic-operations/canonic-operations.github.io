# INVENTION DISCLOSURE FORM

**IDF-0349**

---

## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** 63 derived primitives from HEXAD (D, E, T, R, O, S)

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE/LATTICE.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

---

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for claims, proofs, claims define validity.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**63 derived primitives from HEXAD (D, E, T, R, O, S)**

**The lattice is closed. No more primitives exist.**

### Source Context

# LATTICE (/CANONIC/language/)

inherits: /CANONIC/language/

---

## Complete Composition

**63 derived primitives from HEXAD (D, E, T, R, O, S)**

---

## Layer 1: Singletons (6)

| # | Formula | Name | Meaning |
|---|---------|------|---------|
| 1 | D | DECLARATIVE | Claims |
| 2 | E | EVIDENTIAL | Proofs |
| 3 | T | TEMPORAL | Time |
| 4 | R | RELATIONAL | Boundaries |
| 5 | O | OPERATIONAL | Enforcement |
| 6 | S | STRUCTURAL | Shape |

---

## Layer 2: Pairs (15)

| # | Formula | Name | M...

---

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 4 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## Composition Rules

```
VALIDATE(x) = ∧ { V(i) | i ∈ x }

Example: VALIDATE(PATENT)
       = VALIDATE(D∩E∩T∩R∩O)
       = V(D) ∧ V(E) ∧ V(T) ∧ V(R) ∧ V(O)
       = triad ∧ evidential ∧ temporal ∧ inheritance ∧ operational
```

---

## The Complete Language of Compliance

**6 base terms → 63 derived concepts → ∞ applications**

```
COMPLIANCE = f(D, E, T, R, O, S)

Where:
  D = what you claim
  E = how you prove
  T = when it happened
  R = where it applies
  O = who enforces
  S = how it's shaped
```

Any compliance concept is a subset of {D, E, T, R, O, S}:
- **Audit** = D∩E∩O (verified claims with enforcement)
- **Statute** = D∩T∩R∩O (time-bound jurisdictional law)
- **Certificate** = D∩E∩R (attested claim with boundary)

**The lattice IS the language.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 4 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
