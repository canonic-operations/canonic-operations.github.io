# INVENTION DISCLOSURE FORM

**IDF-0356**

---

## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Declarative

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE/domains/DATA.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

---

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for data, privacy typically lacks structural standard, regulatory.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**Declarative**

**Evidential**

### Source Context

# DATA (/CANONIC/language/domains/)

inherits: /CANONIC/language/

---

## Domain Declaration

```
DATA = PRIVACY_STANDARD × CANONIC
     = Structure(privacy) × (Declarative, Evidential, Temporal, Relational, Operational)
     = owned data/privacy vertical
```

---

## Lattice Formula

```
DATA = Declarative ∩ Evidential ∩ Temporal ∩ Relational ∩ Operational
     = D∩E∩T∩R∩O
     = PATENT (#57)
```

Data/Privacy typically lacks structural standard (S) because:
- **Declarative**: Privacy policies...

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 4 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

---

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE/domains/DATA.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | 16dacdec |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2026-01-23 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 4 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. newsletter signup should collect email address only.
2. PATENT (#57)
```

Data/Privacy typically lacks structural standard (S) because:
- **Declarative**: Privacy policies must be stated
- **Evidential**: Consent and processing must be documented
- **Temporal**: Retention periods, deletion timelines
- **Relational**: Jurisdiction determines applicable law
- **Operational**: Regulators enforce (DPAs, FTC)
- No universal data structure standard (varies by domain)

## Axioms

### 1.
3. PATENT #57)

## Regulatory Mapping

| Framework | Lattice | Key Requirements |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| GDPR | D∩E∩T∩R∩O | Consent, rights, DPO, breach notification |
| CCPA/CPRA | D∩E∩T∩R∩O | Opt-out, deletion, disclosure, CPPA enforcement |
| LGPD | D∩E∩T∩R∩O | Consent, DPO, ANPD oversight |
| PIPEDA | D∩E∩T∩R∩O | Consent, access, OPC complaints |
| Children (COPPA) | D∩E∩T∩R∩O | Parental consent, FTC enforcement |
| Health (HIPAA) | D∩E∩T∩R∩O | See /MEDICINE/ domain |

---

## Example: GDPR Compliance Vertical

```
DECLARE(GDPR) = GDPR_REGULATION × CANONIC

Where:
  GDPR provides Requirements:
    - Lawful basis (Art.
4. PATENT

  Compliance Lifecycle:
    Map       = D∩R (#9)          - Data inventory
    Assess    = D∩E∩R (#23)       - DPIA completed
    Implement = D∩E∩R∩O (#45)     - Controls deployed
    Document  = D∩E∩T∩R (#42)     - ROPA maintained
    Enforce   = D∩E∩T∩R∩O (#57)   - DPO oversight
```

---

## Example: Data Subject Request Handling

```
DECLARE(DSR) = DATA_RIGHTS × CANONIC

Where:
  Data Rights Framework:
    - Access (Art.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 4 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified
