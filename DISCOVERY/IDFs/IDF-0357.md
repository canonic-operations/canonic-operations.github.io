## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Declarative

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE/domains/SAFETY.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for evidential, verification evidence, declarative.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**Declarative**

**Evidential**

### Source Context

# SAFETY (/CANONIC/language/domains/)

inherits: /CANONIC/language/

---

## Domain Declaration

```
SAFETY = SAFETY_STANDARD × CANONIC
       = Structure(safety) × (Declarative, Evidential, Temporal, Relational, Operational)
       = owned safety-critical vertical
```

---

## Lattice Formula

```
SAFETY = Declarative ∩ Evidential ∩ Temporal ∩ Relational ∩ Operational ∩ Structural
       = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S
       = ENTERPRISE (#63)
```

Safety-critical systems ALWAYS require full Enterprise because:...

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 5 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE/domains/SAFETY.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | 16dacdec |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2026-01-23 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 5 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. claims
    - Evidential: Verification evidence
    - Temporal: Development phases
    - Relational: System/software boundary
    - Operational: DER/certification authority

Result:
  DO178C = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) = ENTERPRISE

  Certification Lifecycle:
    Planning      = D∩S (#11)         - PSAC, SDP, SVP, SCMP, SQAP
    Requirements  = D∩E∩T (#22)       - HLR, LLR traced to system
    Design        = D∩E∩T∩S (#44)     - Architecture documented
    Code          = D∩E∩T∩R∩S (#58)   - Implementation traced
    Verification  = D∩E∩T∩R∩O (#57)   - Testing complete
    Configuration = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) - All data controlled
    Certification = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) - SCI/SOI complete
```

---

## Example: Automotive Safety (ISO 26262)

```
DECLARE(ISO26262) = ISO_26262 × CANONIC

Where:
  ISO 26262 provides Structure:
    - Safety lifecycle (12 parts)
    - ASIL determination
    - Hardware/software requirements
    - Functional safety assessment

  CANONIC provides Governance:
    - Declarative: Safety goals, requirements
    - Evidential: Work products, confirmation measures
    - Temporal: Development phases
    - Relational: Item definition boundaries
    - Operational: Safety manager, assessor

Result:
  ISO26262 = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) = ENTERPRISE

  Safety Lifecycle:
    Concept       = D∩R (#9)          - Item definition
    HARA          = D∩E∩R (#23)       - Hazard analysis
    FSC           = D∩E∩R∩O (#45)     - Functional safety concept
    TSC           = D∩E∩R∩O∩S (#60)   - Technical safety concept
    Development   = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) - HW/SW implementation
    Production    = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) - Manufacturing
    Operation     = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) - Field use
```

## Safety Evidence

| Evidence Type | Lattice | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Hazard Log | D∩E∩T∩R (#42) | Hazard tracking |
| Safety Requirements | D∩E∩R (#23) | Safety claims |
| Design Rationale | D∩E∩S (#25) | Design justification |
| Verification Results | E∩T∩O (#33) | Test evidence |
| Traceability Matrix | D∩E∩T∩R∩S (#58) | Bidirectional trace |
| Safety Case | D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) | Certification argument |

## Validators

| Validator | Checks | Example Failure |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Declarative | Safety requirements exist | Missing safety goal |
| Evidential | Evidence complete | Untested safety requirement |
| Temporal | Phases completed | Skipped review milestone |
| Relational | Boundaries defined | Unclear system scope |
| Operational | Assessment complete | No independent review |
| Structural | Standard conformance | Missing required work product |

---

## Application

To create a CANONIC safety vertical:

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 5 |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified
