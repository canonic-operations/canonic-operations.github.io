# INVENTION DISCLOSURE FORM

**IDF-0361**

---

## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Declarative

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE/domains/FINANCE.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

---

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for evidential, audit trails prove accuracy, evidential.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**Declarative**

**Evidential**

### Source Context

# FINANCE (/CANONIC/language/domains/)

inherits: /CANONIC/language/

---

## Domain Declaration

```
FINANCE = FINANCIAL_STANDARD × CANONIC
        = Structure(financial) × (Declarative, Evidential, Temporal, Relational, Operational)
        = owned financial vertical
```

---

## Lattice Formula

```
FINANCE = Declarative ∩ Evidential ∩ Temporal ∩ Relational ∩ Operational ∩ Structural
        = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S
        = ENTERPRISE (#63)
```

Finance requires full Enterprise because:
- **Declarativ...

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 4 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

---

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE/domains/FINANCE.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | 16dacdec |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2026-01-23 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 4 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. claims
- **Evidential**: Audit trails prove accuracy
- **Temporal**: Reporting periods, fiscal years
- **Relational**: Regulatory jurisdiction (SEC, state)
- **Operational**: Auditors, regulators enforce
- **Structural**: GAAP/IFRS accounting standards

---

## Axioms

### 1.
2. claims
    - Evidential: Supporting schedules
    - Temporal: Period end dates
    - Relational: Legal entity structure
    - Structural: GAAP presentation

Result:
  Close = D∩E∩T∩R∩S (#58) = SPECIFICATION

  Close Lifecycle:
    Cutoff    = T∩R (#16)         - Period boundary
    Record    = D∩E∩T (#22)       - Transactions posted
    Reconcile = D∩E∩T∩S (#44)     - Balances verified
    Adjust    = D∩E∩T∩R (#42)     - Corrections made
    Report    = D∩E∩T∩R∩S (#58)   - Statements issued
    Audit     = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) - External attestation
```

## Validators

| Validator | Checks | Example Failure |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Declarative | Financial claims stated | Missing revenue recognition policy |
| Evidential | Audit trail complete | Journal entry without support |
| Temporal | Period cutoff correct | Backdated transaction |
| Relational | Entity scope defined | Intercompany not eliminated |
| Operational | Controls operating | Segregation violation |
| Structural | GAAP conformance | Non-standard presentation |

---

## Application

To create a CANONIC financial vertical:

1.
3. claims** (policies, assertions)
4.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 4 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

## 8. INVENTOR DECLARATION

I, **Dexter Hadley**, declare that:

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
3. AI systems contributed analysis under governance but are not inventors
4. This disclosure is automatically generated pending human review

---

## 9. NOTES
