# INVENTION DISCLOSURE FORM

**IDF-0364**

## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Declarative

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE/domains/SECURITY.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for governance, declarative, declarative.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**Declarative**

**Evidential**

### Source Context

# SECURITY (/CANONIC/language/domains/)

inherits: /CANONIC/language/

---

## Domain Declaration

```
SECURITY = SECURITY_STANDARD × CANONIC
         = Structure(security) × (Declarative, Evidential, Temporal, Relational, Operational)
         = owned security vertical
```

---

## Lattice Formula

```
SECURITY = Declarative ∩ Evidential ∩ Temporal ∩ Relational ∩ Operational ∩ Structural
         = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S
         = ENTERPRISE (#63)
```

Security always requires full Enterprise because:
- ...

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 4 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/canonic-machine/LANGUAGE/domains/SECURITY.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | 16dacdec |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2026-01-23 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 4 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. methodology
    - ISMS documentation

  CANONIC provides Governance:
    - Declarative: Security policy as CANON
    - Evidential: Control evidence in COVERAGE
    - Temporal: Audit cycles, review periods
    - Relational: Scope boundaries
    - Operational: Management review, enforcement

Result:
  ISO27001 = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) = ENTERPRISE

  Certification Lifecycle:
    Scope     = R∩S (#20)         - Boundary defined
    Risk      = D∩E∩R (#23)       - Threats assessed
    Controls  = D∩E∩O∩S (#47)     - Mitigations implemented
    Audit     = D∩E∩T∩R∩O (#57)   - Stage 1 + Stage 2
    Certified = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) - Certificate issued
    Maintain  = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) - Surveillance audits
```

---

## Example: Zero Trust Architecture

```
DECLARE(ZeroTrust) = NIST_800-207 × CANONIC

Where:
  NIST 800-207 provides Structure:
    - Never trust, always verify
    - Assume breach
    - Verify explicitly
    - Use least privilege access

  CANONIC provides Governance:
    - Declarative: Zero trust principles
    - Evidential: Verification logs
    - Temporal: Session validity, token expiry
    - Relational: Microsegmentation boundaries
    - Operational: Policy enforcement points

Result:
  ZeroTrust = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) = ENTERPRISE

  Access Request Flow:
    Request   = D (#1)            - Subject requests access
    Verify    = D∩E (#7)          - Identity validated
    Context   = D∩E∩T∩R (#42)     - Time, location, device checked
    Authorize = D∩E∩T∩R∩O (#57)   - Policy evaluated
    Grant     = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63) - Access with constraints
    Monitor   = E∩T∩O (#33)       - Continuous VaaS
```

## Validators

| Validator | Checks | Example Failure |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Declarative | Security policy exists | No access control policy |
| Evidential | Control evidence documented | Missing penetration test |
| Temporal | Monitoring continuous | Gaps in log collection |
| Relational | Boundaries defined | Unclear system scope |
| Operational | Enforcement active | Disabled security controls |
| Structural | Framework conformance | Missing required controls |

---

## Application

To create a CANONIC security vertical:

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 4 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
3. AI systems contributed analysis under governance but are not inventors
4. This disclosure is automatically generated pending human review
