# INVENTION DISCLOSURE FORM

**IDF-0378**

---

## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Novel Pattern: retired/canonic-machine/canonic

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-machine/canonic/LANGUAGE/nomenclature/NOMENCLATURE.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

---

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for unique, authoritative.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-machine/canonic lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

Pattern establishes novel governance mechanism for domain-specific operations.

### Source Context

# NOMENCLATURE — SPEC

inherits: /CANONIC/language/

---

## Purpose

Defines identity and naming rules for all governed artifacts.

Prevents ambiguity, aliasing, and cross-domain authority leakage.

---

## Identity

An artifact's identity IS its full inheritance path:

```
/CANONIC/language/nomenclature/
```

This path is:
- Unique (no two artifacts share a path)
- Authoritative (the path determines governance)
- Immutable (renaming changes identity)

---

## Naming Rules

| Rule | Rationale |...

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 1 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-machine/canonic ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

---

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/canonic-machine/canonic/LANGUAGE/nomenclature/NOMENCLATURE.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | 9ec7cc9f |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2026-01-23 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 1 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. Unique (no two artifacts share a path)
- Authoritative (the path determines governance)
- Immutable (renaming changes identity)

---

## Naming Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| No abbreviations | "D" has no authority; "Declarative" does |
| No aliases | "DETROS" is mnemonic, not authoritative |
| No synonyms | One name per concept |
| Path-scoped authority | `/a/foo` and `/b/foo` are unrelated |
| No quotation authority | Citing doesn't inherit |

---

## Authority Leakage

Authority leakage occurs when:
- A name is used outside its path
- An alias is treated as authoritative
- Quotation is mistaken for inheritance

The nomenclature rules prevent all three.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 1 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

---

## 8. INVENTOR DECLARATION

I, **Dexter Hadley**, declare that:

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
3. AI systems contributed analysis under governance but are not inventors
4. This disclosure is automatically generated pending human review
