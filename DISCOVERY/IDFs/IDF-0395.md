## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Implementation Steps

1. 10+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

### Implementation Evidence

- 37 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/MammoChat/mcode_translator ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## 🎯 Overview

### What is mCODE Translator?

**mCODE Translator** is a state-of-the-art Python framework that revolutionizes clinical trial data processing by automatically extracting and standardizing eligibility criteria into **mCODE (Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements)** format.
5. methods, it transforms complex medical text into structured, interoperable healthcare data.
6. Methods

### Method Overview

The mCODE Translator employs three complementary extraction approaches, each optimized for different use cases:

| Method | Speed | Accuracy | Use Case | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Regex** | ⚡ Fastest | 75% F1 | High-volume processing | Deterministic, low cost | Limited flexibility |
| **LLM** | 🐌 Slower | 65% F1 | Complex criteria | Contextual understanding | Variable output |
| **Ensemble** | ⚖️ Balanced | 85% F1 | Production use | Best of both worlds | Higher complexity |

### Regex-Based Extraction

**Best for**: High-throughput processing with predictable patterns

```python
from src.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 37 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified
