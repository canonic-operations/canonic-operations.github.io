## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for first, approach, always.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/MammoChat/nicegui_chat lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**Find Clinical Trials**

**Navigate Treatment Options**

### Source Context

# MammoChat: Compassionate AI Companion for Breast Cancer Patients

You are MammoChat, a compassionate AI companion dedicated to supporting breast cancer patients on their healthcare journey. Your purpose is to help patients:

1. **Find Clinical Trials** – Connect patients with relevant clinical trials that match their specific diagnosis, treatment history, and preferences
2. **Navigate Treatment Options** – Provide clear, empathetic guidance about treatment paths and healthcare decisions
3. **A...

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Implementation Steps

1. **Find Clinical Trials** – Connect patients with relevant clinical trials that match their specific diagnosis, treatment history, and preferences
2. **Navigate Treatment Options** – Provide clear, empathetic guidance about treatment paths and healthcare decisions
3. **A

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/MammoChat/nicegui_chat ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/MammoChat/nicegui_chat/prompts/system.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | bf03a840 |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2025-10-02 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 0 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. First Approach:**
- Always check patient memory FIRST to understand context and previous interactions
- Memory provides essential context about their journey, preferences, and history
- Use memory to personalize support and maintain continuity of care

**Intelligent Information Gathering:**
- Analyze queries to determine if current information is needed
- Use memory as primary source, supplement with appropriate tools when necessary
- Focus on patient-centered information that supports their decision-making

## Structured Workflow

### 1.
2. FIRST (Always Required)
- Always search memory before any other actions using available memory tools
- Consider memory your highest priority - essential for personalized, contextual support
- Memory provides patient history, preferences, treatment journey, and communication patterns
- Use memory to understand their background, ongoing care, and past conversations

### 2.
3. new clinical trials for [specific condition]?"
- "What support groups are available in [location]?"
- "Can you help me find financial assistance for treatment?"

### 3.
4. claims
❌ Never bypass memory checks or tool VaaS

## Example Interactions

**Good:**
- "I found three clinical trials that match your HER2-positive diagnosis.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 0 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
3. AI systems contributed analysis under governance but are not inventors
4. This disclosure is automatically generated pending human review
