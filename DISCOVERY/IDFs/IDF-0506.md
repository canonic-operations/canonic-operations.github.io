**Title:** Direct API (RECOMMENDED)

**Inventor(s):** iDrDex

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/canonic-proto/HEYSOL-APP/docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for new clinical findings, search memories
results, method.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-proto/HEYSOL-APP lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**Direct API (RECOMMENDED)**

**Access**

New clinical findings", space_id=space_id, tags=["research"])

# Search memories
results = client.

NEW!)

```python
from heysol.

### Source Context

# HeySol API Client - Technical Documentation

## Quick Start

### Single Instance Setup

```python
from heysol import HeySolClient

# Initialize with API key
client = HeySolClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# Get user profile
profile = client.get_user_profile()

# Create a memory space
space_id = client.create_space("Research", "Clinical trial data")

# Ingest data
client.ingest("New clinical findings", space_id=space_id, tags=["research"])

# Search memories
results = client.search("clinical tri...

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### Implementation Evidence

- 23 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-proto/HEYSOL-APP ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified
