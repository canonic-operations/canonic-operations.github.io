## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for error, handling, memory.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/canonic-proto/HEYSOL-APP lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**Direct API Client**

**MCP Client**

new tools |
| **Error Handling** | HTTP status codes | JSON-RPC error objects | Similar error semantics |
| **Streaming** | Limited | SSE support | MCP supports real-time updates |
| **Session State** | Stateless | Session-based | MCP maintains connection state |
| **Tool Calls** | N/A | Dynamic tool invocation | MCP's core feature |
| **Performance** | Lower latency | Higher latency (session overhead) | API is more direct |
| **Reliability** | High (direct calls) | High (with session management) | Both are reliable |
| **Extensibility** | Fixed endpoints | Extensible tools | MCP can add new capabilities |

## Use Case Analysis

### When to Use Direct API Client

**Best For**:
- Simple, predictable operations
- High-performance requirements
- Resource-constrained environments
- When you know exactly which operations you need
- Batch processing
- CI/CD pipelines
- Server-side applications

**Example Scenarios**:
```python
# Direct API for high-throughput data ingestion
api_client = HeySolAPIClient(api_key="your-key")

for record in large_dataset:
    api_client.

### Source Context

# API vs MCP: Deep Dive Analysis

## Overview

The HeySol client library now supports two distinct approaches for interacting with HeySol services:

1. **Direct API Client** (`HeySolAPIClient`) - REST-based HTTP operations
2. **MCP Client** (`HeySolMCPClient`) - JSON-RPC protocol with tool discovery
3. **Unified Client** (`HeySolClient`) - Composition of both with automatic fallback

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the differences, trade-offs, and use cases for each approach.

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Implementation Steps

1. **Direct API Client** (`HeySolAPIClient`) - REST-based HTTP operations
2. **MCP Client** (`HeySolMCPClient`) - JSON-RPC protocol with tool discovery
3. **Unified Client** (`HeySolClient`) - Composition of both with automatic fallback

### Implementation Evidence

- 11 code block(s) demonstrate working implementation
- Pattern is executable, not merely theoretical

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/canonic-proto/HEYSOL-APP ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. new tools |
| **Error Handling** | HTTP status codes | JSON-RPC error objects | Similar error semantics |
| **Streaming** | Limited | SSE support | MCP supports real-time updates |
| **Session State** | Stateless | Session-based | MCP maintains connection state |
| **Tool Calls** | N/A | Dynamic tool invocation | MCP's core feature |
| **Performance** | Lower latency | Higher latency (session overhead) | API is more direct |
| **Reliability** | High (direct calls) | High (with session management) | Both are reliable |

## Use Case Analysis

### When to Use Direct API Client

**Best For**:
- Simple, predictable operations
- High-performance requirements
- Resource-constrained environments
- When you know exactly which operations you need
- Batch processing
- CI/CD pipelines
- Server-side applications

**Example Scenarios**:
```python
# Direct API for high-throughput data ingestion
api_client = HeySolAPIClient(api_key="your-key")

for record in large_dataset:
    api_client.
2. first, fall back to API if MCP unavailable
result = client.
3. first call), 100-500ms (subsequent)

### Memory Usage

**Direct API**:
- **Client Size**: ~50KB
- **Per Request**: Minimal additional memory
- **State**: None (stateless)

**MCP**:
- **Client Size**: ~75KB
- **Per Request**: Tool cache + session state
- **State**: Session ID, tool registry (~10-50KB)

### Scalability Considerations

**Direct API**:
- ✅ Better for high-frequency operations
- ✅ Lower resource usage
- ✅ Easier horizontal scaling
- ✅ No session management overhead

**MCP**:
- ✅ Better for complex workflows
- ✅ Session reuse reduces overhead
- ✅ Tool caching improves performance
- ❌ Session state can complicate scaling

## Error Handling Differences

### Direct API Error Handling

```python
try:
    result = api_client.
4. Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **Authentication**: Bearer token in Authorization header
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Response Format**: JSON objects
- **Error Handling**: HTTP status codes + JSON error responses

**Example Request**:
```http
POST /add HTTP/1.
5. Methods**: JSON-RPC method calls with `tools/call`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token in Authorization header
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Session Management**: Required session initialization
- **Tool Discovery**: Dynamic tool enumeration
- **Response Format**: JSON-RPC response objects
- **Streaming**: SSE (Server-Sent Events) support

**Example Request**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.
6. method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "memory_ingest",
    "arguments": {
      "message": "Patient data.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 11 |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified
