## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for hadley et al.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/HadleyLab/Dividends-and-Deaths lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

Pattern establishes novel governance mechanism for domain-specific operations.

### Source Context

# CHAPTER TWO — DIVIDENDS: WHERE THE MONEY GOES

The roots of my career stretch back to a small living room in Trinidad where an aging Tandy TRS-80 sat humming beside a stack of schoolbooks. I was ten years old when I taught myself to program on that machine. BASIC was my first language of logic. Every command was a negotiation with order; every error message a kind of instruction about how systems behaved. I didn’t understand it then, but those early lessons—about structure, precision, hierarch...

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH


### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/HadleyLab/Dividends-and-Deaths ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/HadleyLab/Dividends-and-Deaths/drafts/chapter_02.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | fe6f408c |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2025-12-29 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 0 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. first language of logic.
2. first major publication, part of my doctoral thesis, examined the evolutionary conservation of presynaptic neural genes—an early contribution to the genomic foundation of autism research (Hadley et al.
3. new substrate of biology.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 0 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
3. AI systems contributed analysis under governance but are not inventors
4. This disclosure is automatically generated pending human review
