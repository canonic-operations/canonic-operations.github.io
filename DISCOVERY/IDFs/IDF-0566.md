# INVENTION DISCLOSURE FORM

**IDF-0566**

## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Method: System

**Inventor(s):** Dexter Hadley, MD/PhD

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/HadleyLab/Dividends-and-Deaths/concepts/concept_three_engines.md

**Status:** DRAFT — Pending human review

**Confidentiality:** PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL — Prepared for patent counsel

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for procurement, gear, discovery work.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/HadleyLab/Dividends-and-Deaths lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**not**

**gears**

The system approach establishes systematic governance.

### Source Context

# Three Engines

## Purpose
Define the structural engines through which the precision medicine economy generates value and produces harm when governance fails.

## Scope
Applies to chapters that describe how discovery, care, and information systems turn representations into decisions, value, and mortality.

## Category
System Primitive

## Canonical Definition
The precision medicine economy operates through three coupled engines:
1. Discovery
2. Care
3. Information

Each engine converts human li...

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Implementation Steps

1. Discovery
2. Care
3. Information

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/HadleyLab/Dividends-and-Deaths ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/HadleyLab/Dividends-and-Deaths/concepts/concept_three_engines.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | 669d22f0 |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2026-01-01 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 0 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. first on the abstraction, and only later—if ever—on the person.
2. first

#### Procurement Gear
- **Couples to:** Care
- **How it biases toward death:** contracts, formularies, and vendor lock-in narrow the action space before clinicians act

#### Trust Gear
- **Couples to:** Discovery, Information
- **How it biases toward death:** determines whose data is believed and who participates; distrust produces representational absence

#### Labor Gear
- **Couples to:** Care
- **How it biases toward death:** time scarcity and workload compress judgment into protocol and throughput; nuance is priced out

#### Liability Gear
- **Couples to:** Care, Information
- **How it biases toward death:** defensive thresholds and documentation logics prioritize institutional risk minimization over patient harm minimization

#### Attention Gear
- **Couples to:** Care
- **How it biases toward death:** scarcity of bandwidth creates invisible triage; what is not attended to is not treated

#### Canonical Framing Line
“Engines produce action.
3. new medical knowledge (Discovery work)
2.
4. patents and proprietary datasets

#### Failure Mode -> Death
Exclusion from discovery produces invisibility.
5. claims data
- imaging archives
- genomic databases
- AI training sets

#### Outputs
- portability or lock-in
- auditability or opacity
- reuse or erasure
- profit or accountability

#### Failure Mode -> Death
Loss of custody produces uncorrectable harm.
6. Claim (Book-Level)
Mortality is not the cost of innovation.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 0 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
3. AI systems contributed analysis under governance but are not inventors
4. This disclosure is automatically generated pending human review
