## ADMINISTRATIVE

**Title:** Enterprise Code Quality

**Inventor(s):** iDrDex

**Disclosure Date:** 2026-01-30

**Source Reference:** retired/HadleyLab/heysol-api-client/CHANGELOG.md

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for log, management, lean.

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in retired/HadleyLab/heysol-api-client lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

3. 3.0] - 2025-10-01

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader retired/HadleyLab/heysol-api-client ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed

## 6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### 6.1 Source Evidence

| Evidence Type | Authority | Reference |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Source file | GOLD | retired/HadleyLab/heysol-api-client/CHANGELOG.md |
| Git commit | GOLD | d90ef83f |
| Commit date | GOLD | 2025-09-30 |
| Code blocks | SILVER | 0 detected |

### 6.2 Pattern Evidence

The following patterns were detected through EVO LEARNING:

1. unique sources from memory logs
- **Log Management**: Enhanced log filtering capabilities with dedicated source-based queries
- **Documentation**: Refreshed all documentation for GitHub presentation
- **Version Alignment**: Synchronized version numbers across all configuration files

### Changed
- **CLI Commands**: Renamed log commands to follow API naming conventions:
  - `logs delete` now deletes a specific log entry by ID (single item)
  - `logs delete-by-source` now deletes logs by source (batch operation)

## [0.
2. method with fallback to direct API
- **Lean Design**: Minimal dependencies, performant, and maintainable codebase
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotation support
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, API docs, and usage examples

### CLI Commands
- `heysol-client profile` - Get user profile
- `heysol-client spaces list` - List spaces
- `heysol-client spaces create "name"` - Create space
- `heysol-client ingest "message"` - Ingest data
- `heysol-client search "query"` - Search memory
- `heysol-client logs list` - List logs
- `heysol-client logs get-by-source "source"` - Get logs by source
- `heysol-client logs delete-by-source "source" --confirm` - Delete logs by source
- `heysol-client tools` - List MCP tools

### Examples
- `source_filtering_demo.

### 6.3 DETROS Closure

| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Declarative | ✓ | Axioms extracted |
| Evidential | ✓ | Git attribution |
| Temporal | ✓ | Commit timestamp |
| Relational | ✓ | Domain inheritance |
| Operational | ✓ | Code blocks: 0 |
| Structural | ✓ | TRIAD pattern |

## 7. PRIOR ART DISTINCTION

### Distinction from Traditional Approaches

| Prior Art | This Invention |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc governance | Declarative CANON structure |
| Informal agreements | Machine-enforceable constraints |
| Scattered documentation | TRIAD completeness required |
| Manual validation | Automated compliance checking |

### Distinction from Software Patterns

Unlike software design patterns:
- This is **governance pattern**, not code structure
- Inheritance is of **axioms**, not methods
- Validation is **constitutional**, not functional

### Distinction from Standards Bodies

Unlike ISO/IEEE standards:
- Governance is **executable**, not documentary
- Evolution is **ledgered**, not versioned
- Compliance is **verifiable**, not certified

1. I am the inventor of record for this pattern
2. The pattern is demonstrated in the referenced source
3. AI systems contributed analysis under governance but are not inventors
4. This disclosure is automatically generated pending human review
