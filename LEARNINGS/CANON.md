# LEARNINGS — CANON

inherits: /CANONIC/OPERATIONS/

---

## Axiom

**GIVEN closed EVO, LEARNINGS applies DETROS governance.**

EVO guarantees CLOSURE from LEDGER (machine).
LEARNINGS synthesizes patterns for human decisions (governance).

---

## Relationship to EVO

```
EVO (closed)              LEARNINGS (open)
═══════════════           ═══════════════════
CLOSURE from LEDGER   →   DETROS governance
Machine compliance    →   Human synthesis
discover.py           →   STRATEGY.md
evidence-derived      →   pattern-extracted
```

## DETROS Governance

| Dimension | LEARNINGS Application |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **D** (Doctrine) | Pattern axioms, strategic principles |
| **E** (Evidence) | Sources: transcripts, deals, discovery |
| **T** (Types) | Pattern categories (enterprise, network, etc.) |
| **R** (References) | Cross-links to ORGS, DEALS |
| **O** (Operations) | Actionable insights |
| **S** (Structure) | Observation → Insight → Action |

---

## Children

| Child | DETROS Focus |
|-------|--------------|
| STRATEGY.md | D + O (doctrine + operations) |
| SALES.md | E + O (evidence + operations) |
| TECHNICAL.md | T + S (types + structure) |
| MARKET.md | R + E (references + evidence) |

---

## Sources (Evidence)

1. **Transcripts** → Raw conversation intelligence
2. **Deals** → Win/loss analysis
3. **Discovery** → IDF pattern recognition (from EVO)
4. **External** → Network, conferences, research

---

## Pattern Structure

```markdown
## {Pattern Name}

1. **Observation** - What happened (E)
2. **Insight** - What it means (D)
3. **Action** - What to do about it (O)
```

---

## Flow

```
EVO.output(DISCOVERY)
    ↓ human review
LEARNINGS.extract(patterns)
    ↓ DETROS synthesis
STRATEGY.md, SALES.md, etc.
    ↓ informs
FINANCIALS/ + FORECASTS/
```
