# PROV-001 — DETROS LANGUAGE SYSTEM

## Provisional Patent Application

**Title:** DETROS: A Six-Dimensional Governance Language for Computational Compliance

**Inventors:** Dexter Hadley, MD PhD

**Filing Date:** [PENDING]

---

## Abstract

DETROS (Declarative, Evidential, Temporal, Relational, Operational, Structural) is a six-bit dimensional language system for computational governance. Each dimension is represented by a single bit (D=1, E=2, T=4, R=8, O=16, S=32), enabling 64 distinct compliance states.

The system defines three compliance tiers:
- COMMUNITY (35): Basic closure with D + E + S dimensions
- BUSINESS (39): Evolution with D + E + T + S dimensions
- ENTERPRISE (63): Full governance with all 6 dimensions

---

## Claims

1. A method for computational governance using bitwise dimension encoding.
2. A system for validating compliance through dimensional file mapping.
3. A method for LEARNING EVOLUTION through gap detection and closure.
4. A framework for hierarchical inheritance in governance documents.
