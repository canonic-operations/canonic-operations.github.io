## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing systems lack structured mechanisms for adventhealth = enterprise healthcare deployment. hipaa-compliant clinical ai..

**The core problem:** Existing approaches in adventhealth-rob lack systematic governance mechanisms that are declarative, evidential, and machine-enforceable.

---

## 2. CORE INVENTIVE INSIGHT

**ADVENTHEALTH = Enterprise healthcare deployment. HIPAA-compliant clinical AI.**

ADVENTHEALTH = Enterprise healthcare deployment. HIPAA-compliant clinical AI.

### Source Context

# ADVENTHEALTH — CANON

inherits: /SHOP/MED/

---

## Lattice Formula

```
ADVENTHEALTH = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S (#63)
```

---

## Axiom

**ADVENTHEALTH = Enterprise healthcare deployment. HIPAA-compliant clinical AI.**

---

## Axioms

### Infrastructure

- Deployment MUST use AdventHealth-approved infrastructure.
- Data MUST remain within AdventHealth Azure tenant.
- Systems MUST integrate with AdventHealth Active Directory.

### Operations

- Monitoring MUST feed into AdventHealth SOC.
- Incidents MUST

## 3. TECHNICAL APPROACH

### DETROS Compliance

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| **D**eclarative | Explicit axioms define behavior |
| **E**vidential | Git history provides GOLD evidence |
| **T**emporal | Commit timestamps establish priority |
| **R**elational | Inherits from parent CANON |
| **O**perational | Executable patterns demonstrated |
| **S**tructural | TRIAD structure (CANON/VOCAB/README) |

---

## 4. ADVANTAGES

### Structural Clarity
Governance is explicit and verifiable through CANON structure.

### Evidential Foundation
All claims backed by GOLD evidence (git commits, code, tests).

### Temporal Priority
Commit history establishes clear invention timeline.

### Composability
Pattern integrates with broader adventhealth-rob ecosystem.

### Machine Enforcement
TRIAD (LLM reads → Human reviews → Machine enforces) ensures compliance.

---

## 5. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS (NOT CLAIMED)

1. **Specific domain content** — What the domain contains is not claimed
2. **Specific data values** — Particular data instances are implementation
3. **Specific UI/UX** — User interface design is not claimed
4. **Specific algorithms** — Implementation algorithms are flexible
5. **Specific hardware** — No hardware dependency claimed
